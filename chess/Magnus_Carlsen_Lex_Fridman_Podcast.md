# Magnus Carlsen podcast

Magnus Carlsen was on the [Lex Fridman podcast](https://lexfridman.com/magnus-carlsen/). The podcast is (as usual) way too long, but there were some interesting points that are applicable outside chess.

* Carlsen said he feels like he plays more creatively when sleep deprived. Apparently this is not a unique finding in fields outside chess (and perhaps matches my experience). Also mentioned drinking alchol to improve creativity because it reduces inhabitions. Apparently people speak second languages better when slightly drunk. 

* Carlsen often plays sub-optimal lines in gameplay because they are less analysed. To win games now you need to do this. Seems like he assumed everyone knew this, and I guess it makes sense.
