# Animal Sound Datasets

There's a whole field of human-animal communications (or animal-animal) that seems pretty interesting.

## Datasets 

### CatMeows

>This dataset, composed of 440 sounds, contains meows emitted by cats in different contexts. Specifically, 21 cats belonging to 2 breeds (Maine Coon and European Shorthair) have been repeatedly exposed to three different stimuli that were expected to induce the emission of meows

### PIPAN/HARPs

> The Pacific Islands Passive Acoustic Network (PIPAN) is designed to provide long-term monitoring of cetaceans in remote regions or areas of special interest. PIPAN sites are currently monitored using bottom-mounted passive acoustic data recorders called HARPs (high-frequency acoustic recording packages).
